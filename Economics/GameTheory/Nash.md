We can now understand how it’s possible for peace and co-operation to emerge in a group whose members don’t necessarily have a natural penchant for altruism, but who simply “live and let live” . Now let's try to see a little beyond the tip of our nose. What happens if we repeat the experiment over time, in a larger-scale group? Because as you probably know, in the view of evolutionary theorists, “winners” manage to successfully reproduce ... while “losers” die out: and the same is true of behaviour! In a group, types of behaviour that harm the individual members end up dying out after a number of generations… even if they’re beneficial for the group as a whole. And it’s the same thing the other way around! Let's try to understand this phenomenon with a new game: Step 1: We take 5 representatives of each strategy:
🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
😼😼😼😼😼
🧙🧙🧙🧙🧙
👑👑👑👑👑
🃏🃏🃏🃏🃏
Step 2: We have them all play against each other in 10-round matches. For example, a Queen 🌹 will play against 4 other Queens 🌹, 5 Magicians 🧙, 5 Copycats 😼, 5 Kings 👑 and 5 Jokers 🃏.
🌹 vs 🌹 (x5) / 🌹 vs😼 (x5) / 🌹 vs 🧙 (x5) / 🌹 vs👑 (x5) 🌹 vs 🃏 (x5)
😼 vs 😼 (x5) / 😼 vs 🧙 (x5) / 😼 vs👑 (x5) / 😼 vs 🃏 (x5)
🧙 vs 🧙 (x5) / 🧙 vs 👑 (x5) / 🧙 vs 🃏 (x5)
👑 vs 👑 (x5) / 👑 vs 🃏 (x5)
🃏 vs 🃏 (x5)
Step 3: At the end of the tournament, we eliminate the 5 players who earned the least number of points… and we duplicate the 5 players who obtained the best score. For example, if the Kings 👑 have obtained the least number of points and the Jokers 🃏 the highest number of points, there will be 5 Queens 🌹, 5 Magicians 🧙, 5 Copycats 😼, and 10 Jokers 🃏 left… but not a single King 👑! Thus, the number of representatives of each strategy will have changed at the end of the tournament.
And then what ?
Step 4: We repeat the experiment until there’s only one type of player left!



diff - " Do unto others as you would have others do unto you " is not only a moral law, but also a mathematical one.

But in that case, how can we explain why there are so many people in our societies who don’t trust each other and systematically play their own game
