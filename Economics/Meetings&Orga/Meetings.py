Regulating housing quality:
evidence from France*

Preliminary draft

Abstract

Minimum quality standards in housing markets can affect the equilibrium quantity of dwellings supplied,

depending on the demand response to their shadow monetary and non-monetary costs. To estimate the conse-
quences of quality regulations, this paper studies a rule requiring new single-family constructions in France to

use the services of an architect, whenever their square footage exceeds a threshold. Using exhaustive admin-
istrative data on the universe of building permits in France and quasi-experimental variation in the threshold,

I evidence that the cost of new housing production jumps above the notch, which in turn leads to substantial

distortions in the size distribution of homes. New units bunch below the regulatory notch to avoid addi-
tional costs, and additions to existing dwellings are downsized or avoided to circumvent the requirement.

Regression discontinuity estimates reveal that homeowners characteristics, dwelling type, and spatial loca-
tion choices all change sharply at the threshold, evidencing a segmentation of households by their taste for

housing quality. Overall, the attribute-based regulation leads to significant misallocation of housing consump-
tion.
