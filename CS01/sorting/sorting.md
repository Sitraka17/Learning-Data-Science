Example of a Library 



Most American libraries use some combination of two systems for organizing most of their books â€” the Dewey Decimal System and the Library of Congress System. These systems give every single book a topic identifier that can be alphabetized.

In the Library of Congress System, every history book has an identifier that starts with 
D
,
D, every book about Asian history has an identifier that starts with 
DS
,
DS, and any book about Indonesian history has an identifier that starts with 
DS
615.
DS615.

For a library using this system, alphabetizing by identifier naturally puts books next to others with similar topics.
