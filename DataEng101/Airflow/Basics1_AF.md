# Using Apache Airflow with Oracle

Apache Airflow is a platform for programming, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. This guide will walk you through the basics of using Airflow with Oracle.

## Prerequisites

- Apache Airflow installed on your system
- Oracle client library installed on your system

## Steps

### 1. Install Apache Airflow

If you haven't already, install Apache Airflow on your system. You can do this using pip, Docker, or by following the instructions in the [official documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation.html).

### 2. Install Oracle Client

Apache Airflow needs a way to interact with your Oracle database. This is typically done using an Oracle client library. Install the appropriate Oracle client library for your system.

### 3. Create a Connection in Airflow

Create a connection in Airflow to your Oracle database. This involves providing the necessary connection details such as the host, port, database name, username, and password.

### 4. Create a DAG

A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a collection of all the tasks you want to run, organized in a way that reflects their relationships and dependencies. In your case, you might create a DAG that extracts data from your Oracle database.

### 5. Create Tasks

Tasks are the individual units of work in Airflow. In your case, you might create a task that uses the Oracle client to execute a SQL query and retrieve data from your database.

### 6. Schedule the DAG

Once your DAG is created, you can schedule it to run at regular intervals. This could be hourly, daily, weekly, or whatever interval is appropriate for your use case.

### 7. Monitor the DAG

After your DAG is scheduled, you can monitor its progress in the Airflow web interface. This will allow you to see if any tasks are failing and why.

### 8. Handle Errors

If any tasks fail, Airflow will automatically retry them a certain number of times. If a task continues to fail after all retries have been exhausted, Airflow will mark it as failed and send an alert. You can configure these alerting mechanisms to suit your needs.
