seven bridges to develop a *systematic* approach to solve this puzzle.
Although it will seem impractical, this type of approach leverages the core strength of computers â€” quickly and tirelessly doing many tasks.


Variables are letters or other symbols that stand in for changing or unknown values.

They let us write down relationships between quantities in a simple, compact way.

They allow us to represent unknown values.

They can help reveal patterns in the information you start with, so that you can find a quick path between that information and the solution you're after.
