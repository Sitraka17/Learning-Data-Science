> What is Git?
Git is a free, open-source version control software. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. This tool is a version control system that was initially developed to work with several developers on the Linux kernel.

This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So Git can be used to store content â€” and it is mostly used to store code because of the other features it provides.

Real life projects generally have **multiple developers working in parallel**. So they need a version control system like Git to make sure that there are no code conflicts between them.
