You may want to convert one data type into another. You can convert a variable into a different type with the int() , str() , bool() , or float() functions, depending on what you want the final data type to be. To add integers and strings, you first need to use str() to convert the integer to a string. 
print('I completed ' + str(3) + ' courses!')


c) Importing packages

A package is a collection of code. To use a package, import it using the format: import package . The numpy package contains code for array computing. To import numpy , write import numpy . import numpy A commonly used function in numpy is array() . To use it, you must reference the package name using the format package.function() .
To install Python packages on your own system, you can use *pip* , a package maintenance system. Once installed, *pip* allows you to install packages like numpy from the terminal. pip3 install numpy After you install a package, you can import the package to a script using import package_name to use the code the package contains. *import numpy*



d) Method

A method is a function that works on a specific type of object. Each Python object has specific methods depending on the object type. Methods are called using dot notation: object.method() . When the .capitalize() method is called on a string, it returns a string with the first letter capitalized. greet = 'hello' print(greet.capitalize()) print(greet)

e) .append() method 

The .append() list method adds a new element to the end of a list. This changes the list it is applied to by extending it. l.append('horse') will append the string 'horse' to the end of the list l . l = [1, 2, 3] l.append('horse') print(l) [1, 2, 3, 'horse']
