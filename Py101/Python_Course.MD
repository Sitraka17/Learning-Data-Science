You may want to convert one data type into another. You can convert a variable into a different type with the int() , str() , bool() , or float() functions, depending on what you want the final data type to be. To add integers and strings, you first need to use str() to convert the integer to a string. 
print('I completed ' + str(3) + ' courses!')


c) Importing packages

A package is a collection of code. To use a package, import it using the format: import package . The numpy package contains code for array computing. To import numpy , write import numpy . import numpy A commonly used function in numpy is array() . To use it, you must reference the package name using the format package.function() .
To install Python packages on your own system, you can use *pip* , a package maintenance system. Once installed, *pip* allows you to install packages like numpy from the terminal. pip3 install numpy After you install a package, you can import the package to a script using import package_name to use the code the package contains. *import numpy*



d) Method

A method is a function that works on a specific type of object. Each Python object has specific methods depending on the object type. Methods are called using dot notation: object.method() . When the .capitalize() method is called on a string, it returns a string with the first letter capitalized. greet = 'hello' print(greet.capitalize()) print(greet)

e) .append() method 

The .append() list method adds a new element to the end of a list. This changes the list it is applied to by extending it. l.append('horse') will append the string 'horse' to the end of the list l . l = [1, 2, 3] l.append('horse') print(l) [1, 2, 3, 'horse']






What is a class in Python?
A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).  
What is an object in Python?
An object is an instance of a class. It is a specific example of the class that contains its own data and methods.  
What is the difference between a class and an object?
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class that has its own unique attribute and behavior.
What is inheritance in Python?
Inheritance is a mechanism in which a new class is derived from an existing class. The derived class inherits all the attributes and behavior of the existing class and can also add new attributes and behavior of its own.
What is polymorphism in Python?
Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways. In Python, this is achieved by defining methods with the same name in different classes, and then using a single function or method to call the method that is appropriate for the type of object that is passed as an argument.
What is encapsulation in Python?
Encapsulation refers to the practice of keeping an object's data and methods hidden from other parts of the program, and only allowing them to be accessed through a well-defined interface. In Python, this is achieved through the use of private and protected attributes and methods, which cannot be accessed from outside the class.
What is the difference between a class method and a static method in Python?
A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the object. It receives the class as implicit first argument, just like an instance method receives the instance. A static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of the class. It doesn't receive any special first argument and it works with the class and its attributes.
What are the benefits of using object-oriented programming in Python?
The benefits of using object-oriented programming in Python include: code reusability, encapsulation,
