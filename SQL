-- Rename the organisation column
ALTER TABLE affiliations
RENAME COLUMN organisation TO organization;

-- Delete the university_shortname column
ALTER TABLE affiliations
DROP COLUMN university_shortname;


-- Insert unique professors into the new table
INSERT INTO professors 
SELECT DISTINCT firstname, lastname, university_shortname 
FROM university_professors;

-- Doublecheck the contents of professors
SELECT * 
FROM professors;

-- Insert unique affiliations into the new table
INSERT INTO affiliations 
SELECT DISTINCT firstname, lastname, function, organization 
FROM university_professors;

-- Doublecheck the contents of affiliations
SELECT * 
FROM affiliations;

-- Perfect. You can see that there are 1377 distinct combinations of professors and organisations in the dataset. We'll migrate the other two tables universities and organisations for you. The last thing to do in this chapter is to delete the no longer needed university_professors table.
