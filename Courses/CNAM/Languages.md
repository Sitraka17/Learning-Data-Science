Agreements and negations

If two characters say exactly the same thing, they are either both lying, or both telling the truth.

If one character's statement is the logical negation of another character's statement, then one of those characters must be telling the truth and the other must be lying.


Finding truths and falsehoods

Look for statements that provide global information when you assume they are true or false. Usually these statements tell you about the group of characters, not just one. If you find one, make the assumption and then check to see if the other statements are consistent.
