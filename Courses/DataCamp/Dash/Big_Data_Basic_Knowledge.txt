Big Data. Big words for little results?

For someone in the business, this expression only describes a set of parameters, analyses and strategies.

But let's put ourselves in the shoes of a small business owner. This expression does not evoke anything concrete.

It is even a bit scary. When someone mentions the possibility of applying it in his structure, the boss may have the impression that it will just be additional work.

A new workload that is too big, too complex, too time consuming.

And all this for what? Benefits that are sometimes unclear and uncertain.

We understand that the importance of Big Data is not obvious to everyone.

So if you're a small business owner, here are 3 reasons why you should opt for Big Data:

1️⃣ Big Data allows you to better understand and therefore better serve your customers

2️⃣ Big Data allows your business to not be left behind when the market changes

3️⃣ Big Data does not complicate your processes, on the contrary, it allows you to improve and simplify them

Plus, it's not complicated to implement a Big Data strategy when you have the right methods.
