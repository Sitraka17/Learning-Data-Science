Computer science is the study of  ** COMPUTATION **, ** AUTOMATION **, and ** INFORMATION **.
Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) 
to practical disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).
Computer science is generally considered an area of academic research and distinct from computer programming.


Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science.



In general, when computers have to search a large amount of information, they do one of two things:

Search the records one by one, like Tiye scanning each of her books to find the ones by Leo Tolstoy. Computers can do this very fast, especially when they can utilize parallelism.

Consult a separate list of the information — an index — that's in a useful order and acts like a card catalog.
