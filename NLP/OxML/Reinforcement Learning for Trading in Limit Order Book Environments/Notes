# Reinforcement Learning for Trading in Limit Order Book Environments


Optimal Execution (OE) : 
Bertsimas and Lo (1998) have deﬁned best execution as the dynamic trading strategy that **provides the minimum expected cost of trading over a ﬁxed period of time,** and they show that in a variety of circumstances one can ﬁnd such a strat- egy by employing a dynamic optimization procedure; but their approach ignores the volatility of revenues for diﬀerent trading strategies.


To train good policies with RL lots of experience is needed
(sample ineiciency)
I Limit order books (LOBs) are a widespread market
mechanism relevant for data-rich high frequency finance
I Intro to LOBs: First, we will look at the limit order books as a
market mechanism in detail
I In this context, we will also explain the role and challenge
faced by a market maker
I Ways to model LOBs: Then, we will then discuss dierent
ways to create LOB environments for RL
I Hands-on RL demo: Finally, focusing on one of these ways, I
will give an RL demo using mbt_gym (freely available
