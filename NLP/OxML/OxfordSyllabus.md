# Summurized: 

### PCA is no more a great tool for funds, can be a little bite used for risk management but clearly not a great tool anymore. You minimized the Variance but the returns are equals to 0. 


Beta (β) is a measure of the volatility—or systematic risk—of a security or portfolio compared to the market as a whole (usually the S&P 500). Stocks with betas higher than 1.0 can be interpreted as more volatile than the S&P 500.
