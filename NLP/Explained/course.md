What is a transformer ? 



1) NLP's Transformer is a new architecture that aims to solve tasks **sequence-to-sequence** while easily handling **long-distance** dependencies.

2) Computing the input and output representations without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolutions and it relies entirely on self-attention.
